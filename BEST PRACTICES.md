- :heavy_check_mark: **State the actual change** or enhancement in the commit message of PRs (do not just state ‚ÄúFixes issue #123‚Äù).

- :heavy_check_mark: **Add the issue number** into the description (this helps to speed up reviews as reviewers can simply click to get more info in the issue itself).

- :heavy_check_mark: Write **clear meaningful git commit messages** [Do read](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

- :heavy_check_mark: Match pull requests with issues and make sure your pull requests description contains **GitHub‚Äôs special keyword** references that automatically close the related issue when the pull request is merged. [More info](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests).

- :heavy_check_mark: When you make very minor changes to a pull request of yours (like for example fixing a failing travis build or some small style corrections or minor changes requested by reviewers) **make sure you squash your commits** afterwards so that you don‚Äôt have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix [Learn how to squash](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git).

- :heavy_check_mark: **Add a screenshot** if you changed anything in the UI of a project. When you‚Äôre submitting a pull request for a UI-related issue, please add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your pull request. It makes it much easier for the reviewers and helps to speed up the process. You‚Äôll also get reviews quicker.

- :heavy_check_mark: **Add a link to your deployment of the project**, where reviewers can check out what you have changed (especially for smaller changes this is very helpful as the reviewer might not even need to set up the system itself and test it. Again this speeds up the review process a lot).

- :heavy_check_mark: **Always ensure CI and tests are successful**.

- :heavy_check_mark: Help to **resolve merge conflicts** (especially if there are several PRs at the same time, merge conflicts are common. Help the reviewers and solve merge conflicts to speed up the process.).

- :heavy_check_mark: Merging Pull Requests should only happen if **at least two contributors reviewed the PR and approved it**.

- :heavy_check_mark: If you are involved in a topic you don‚Äôt understand yet, **try to learn yourself as much as possible from public channels** (wikipedia, stackoverflow) but also **do not hesitate to ask questions** to other developers.
